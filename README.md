## Assignment Testing and Evaluation

All the points will be awarded automatically, by
**evaluating your functions against a given test suite**.

When you run

```shellsession
$ make
```

or

```shellsession
$ stack test
```

Your last lines should have

```
All N tests passed (...)
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**or**

```
K out of N tests failed
OVERALL SCORE = ... / ...
```

**If your output does not have one of the above your code will receive a zero**

The other lines will give you a readout for each test.
You are encouraged to try to understand the testing code,
but you will not be graded on this.

## Submission Instructions

To submit your code, just do:

```shellsession
$ make turnin
```
